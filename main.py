st.markdown('The AI prediction model, developed using the eXGBoosting Machine (eXGBM) algorithm, demonstrated outstanding performance in predicting postoperative in-hospital mortality in geriatric hip fracture patients. It exhibited the highest scores in various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, specificity, F1 score, Brier score, and log loss. With an AUC of 0.908, the model showcased excellent discrimination ability. Additionally, the model showed favorable calibration, indicating its accuracy in estimating risk levels. The comprehensive scoring system ranked the eXGBM model as the top-performing model, further validating its predictive capability. This AI model is freely accessible for research purposes, providing a valuable tool for enhancing clinical decision-making in managing geriatric hip fracture patientsâ€™ in-hospital mortality risk.')
